# Mental Health Analysis

# Dataset source: https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/ 

Mental health is essential to our wellbeing and affects how we feel and act every day. There 
is still a need to identify risk factors for a diagnosis, so public health measures can provide targeted 
interventions. We were interested in determining risk factors for a depression diagnosis and 
considered a range of characteristics including other mental health diagnoses, location of 
treatment, and sociodemographic factors. We conducted unsupervised learning with k-means 
clustering. We also conducted supervised learning methods to predict age based on mental health 
diagnoses with lasso regression and classification to identify risk factors for a depression diagnosis 
with decision trees and random forests models. We determined that mental health diagnoses were 
not predictive of age. We, however, identified that alcohol and substance abuse, anxiety, and 
ADHD diagnosis from our decision tree and that bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and state location 
from our random forest are predictive of a depression diagnosis.
